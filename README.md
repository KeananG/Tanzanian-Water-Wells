 # Conclusion

When comparing the accuracy and recall scores from the baseline model to the final model, 

Baseline:
- Accuracy - 57%
- Recall - 57%

Final Model:
- Accuracy - 81%
- Recall - 81%

The final model used a random forest with optimized parameters. This model can be used to predict is a well is functional, non functional, or functional and needs repair. Safe access to clean water is a basic human right, these wells are important to ensuring that this human right is met. My model can help the Tanzanian government determine if a well needs to be fixed.
